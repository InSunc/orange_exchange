# Orange Exchange

## Instructions
1. Create a db schema named exchangedb or change the _application.properties_ as you please

The main class of the project (_ExchangeApplication.java_) populates the DB.

2. Use swagger-ui to test the API (4.c didn't manage to finish):
```
https://localhost:[PORT]/swagger-ui.html
```
